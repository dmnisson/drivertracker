<p>DriverTracker will be an ASP.NET-based analytics application for taxicab drivers and transportation network
carriers to analyze performance of employees. When a ride is requested, representatives can enter the
request time into the system. Drivers then input their actual pickup times, the start and endpoints,
and the arrival time and fare. This will be facilitated by the mobile DriverTracker app, which will use
GPS to verify the driver's location and digital signatures to prevent rogue modifications to the app.</p>
